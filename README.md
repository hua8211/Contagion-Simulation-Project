# Contagion-Simulation-Project
#
#
#This project is inspired by the Washington Postâ€™s article (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/)that simulated infectiousness with 2D cells in a graphical visualization. 
#Simulations such as this are great sandboxes to practice and learn object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, and methods.
